<p>Last year, our team started using a private blog to keep track of the hours our members put into the team. As a sophomore, I was put in charge of maintaining the site and dealing with any issues that students encountered.</p>

<p>Through my role as the webmaster of the blog, I used a lot of SQL to reference data stored on the team server.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, once again, the code to our blog is private and the site is password protected. I will attach some photos of the site below.</p>

<p>Moving forward, the team plans to continue using the blog. As the webmaster of the blog, I plan to continue to improve the blog and add features that will aid the team.</p>
