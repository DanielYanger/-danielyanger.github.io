I"v<h1 id="bronze">Bronze</h1>

<p>Today was my first attempt at USACO. Prior to this, I had very little exposure to competative programming. I relied mainly on my Java knowledge from AP Computer Science A to get me through. Since it was my first time, I was in the bronze division. I scored a 1000 on my first attempt, giving me a promotion into Silver.</p>

<p>I plan to continue to participate in USACO. Due to the robotics season starting up very shortly, I will have little time to practice and prepare for Silver. However, I will try my best throughout all of the competitions.</p>
