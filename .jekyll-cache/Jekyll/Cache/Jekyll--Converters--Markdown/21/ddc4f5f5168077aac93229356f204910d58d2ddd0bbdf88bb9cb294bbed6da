<p>Taking a quick break from my development for robotics, I decided to do something I had been meaning to for a while: create a visuzlization for sorting. This had always fasciated me so I decided to finally give it a go using Python.</p>

<h1 id="skills">Skills</h1>

<p>This project introduced me to the Tkinter library as well as more features of the Matplotlib. Furthermore, I learned a great deal about the various sorting methods I implemented, including ones I just learned such as gnome, even-odd, and cocktail shaker.</p>

<h1 id="git-project">Git Project</h1>

<p>The project can be found <a href="https://github.com/DanielYanger/Python-Projects/blob/master/visualiztionSorter.py">here</a>.</p>

<p>Even though I had some trouble getting started because I named a couple of files things I shouldnâ€™t have, I really had a fun time making this. I definetly want to explore similar projects later this summer, including creating a visulization in React and potentially delve into pathfinding.</p>
