<p>This event was very exciting for me as it was my first offical competition with my schoolâ€™s Academic Decathelon team. Our team performed very well, placing second in Super Quiz and 3rd overall. Individually, I also placed 2nd overall in math and 3rd overall in speech. Furthermore, I was my teamâ€™s highest individual score with a 8,524.1 out of 10,000. We have also qualified for state with is a couple of weeks.</p>
