<p>After learning Node and Express, I wanted to continue my journey to becoming a full stack developer. With that, I decided to learn about implementing MongoDB into my Express apps.</p>

<p>With this project, I learned a great deal about NoSQL and how MongoDB stores data. Furthermore, I learned how to make API calls and process the data using mongoose and Express.</p>

<p>I have a lot of sensitive information on the Git project that I forgot to hide before pushing so I will not be sharing the project.</p>

<p>Now that I have learned how to use MongoDB, I plan to freshen up a bit on React and then become a full stack developer! Stay tuned for that.</p>
