I"d<h1 id="bronze">Bronze</h1>

<p>Today was my first attempt at USACO. Prior to this, I had very little exposure to competative programming. I relied mainly on my Java knowledge from AP Computer Science A to get me through. Since it was my first time, I was in the bronze division. I scored a 1000 on my first attempt, giving me a promotion into Silver.</p>
