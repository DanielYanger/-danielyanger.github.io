<p>Through this adventure of figuring out the theme issues, I was able to learn more about many different things, including Git and Jekyll.</p>

<p>I like this theme so Iâ€™ll probably stick with it for a while. I might add a page where all of my posts are visible since I did like that from my previous theme.</p>
