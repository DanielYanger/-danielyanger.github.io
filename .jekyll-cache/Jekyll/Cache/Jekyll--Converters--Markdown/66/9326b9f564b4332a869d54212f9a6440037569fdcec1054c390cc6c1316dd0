<p>This is my first project that I am working on with my robotics team, FRC Team 624. We are creating a website to host our scouting system.</p>

<h1 id="skills">Skills</h1>

<p>I learned a lot of useful skills through this project including php, CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I worked on mostly the design of certain modules within the site. I used Javascript to make integer incrementors and zebra striped, sortable tables.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the code to our scouting database is not avalible to the public. However, I will try and include some images of my work below.</p>

<p>I hope to continue to adapt the site as we refine our scouting system.</p>
