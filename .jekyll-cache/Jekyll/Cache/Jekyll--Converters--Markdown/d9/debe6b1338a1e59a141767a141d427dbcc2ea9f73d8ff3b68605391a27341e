<p>Now that I know the basics of Python, I decided to apply some of what I learned and create a quick game of Pong. This Pong game gradually speeds up as the game progresses, making it more and more challenging the longer the rally is.</p>

<p>In addition to improving my basic Python knowledge, I learned about the Python library Turtles and random. Both of these were useful in creating the project.</p>

<p>The project can be found <a href="https://github.com/DanielYanger/Python-Projects/blob/master/pong.py">here</a>.</p>

<p>I plan to continue to create small Python projects to improve my python knowledge but with AP exams coming up, I may not have much time.</p>
