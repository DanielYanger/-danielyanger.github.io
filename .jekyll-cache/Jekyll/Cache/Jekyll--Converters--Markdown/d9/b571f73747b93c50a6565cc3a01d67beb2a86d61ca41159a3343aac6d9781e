<p>As part of my overhaul of my teamâ€™s scouting system, I have made a Windows Form that will link the different apps and merge the files.</p>

<h1 id="skills">Skills</h1>

<p>Through this project, I dipped my toes into C# and made a Windows Form in Visual Studio. Additionally, I learned how to make API calls in python and how to properly parse through a JSON file in python.</p>

<h1 id="git-project">Git Project</h1>

<p>The project can be found <a href="https://github.com/DanielYanger/624-Scouting-Manager">here</a>.</p>

<p>I plan to continue to work on the project and finish debugging it in preparation for next season.</p>
