I"‰<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This is the code for my robotics teamâ€™s 2018 robot, PaCRat. PaCRat is coded in LabVIEW. This was my first year on the programming subteam and my first exposure to LabVIEW. As a graphical language, it was very different from other text based languages that I had been learning about such as HTML or Java.</p>

<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

<p>This was my first project that used LabVIEW. Additionally, I learned a lot about hardware integration while programming the robot, such as using encoders, motor controllers, and various sensors.</p>

<h2 id="git-project">Git Project</h2>

<p>The repository for the project is located <a href="https://github.com/Team624/2018Robot">here</a>. As a freshman and novice programmer, I did most of my testing on separate branches that were later merged onto the master branch by senior programmers.</p>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>

<p>This is the end of this project as the 2018 FRC season comes to a close. However, I have 3 more years of robotics left in high school so there will be 3 more robots left to program. Looking forward to these new challenges!</p>
