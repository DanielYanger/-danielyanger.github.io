<p>With summer in full swing and a realitivly light course load for summer school, I took this oppurtunity to start learning Node.</p>

<h1 id="skills">Skills</h1>

<p>With this project, I learned a great deal about Node JS, APIs, and Express JS. Furthermore, it was a refresher in JavaScript for me after not using it for a long time.</p>

<p>The project can be found <a href="https://github.com/DanielYanger/Learning-Node">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now that I have learned Node, I plan to freshen up a bit on React and then become a full stack developer! Stay tuned for that.</p>
