<p>Following the cancellation of the 2020 FRC Season and the subsequent postponement of school, I deceided to take this oppurtunity to revamp our teamâ€™s programming curriculum. I created 9 different levels split into 3 categories: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each level is designed to teach incoming programers about LabVIEW and coding.</p>

<p>Through the development of this curriulum, I learned a lot about preparing teaching materials and lessons. Each level started with a lesson plan that had objectives, resources, and homework. Some of the lessons then required a presentation to be created while others did not.</p>

<p>Since next year will be my senior year, I plan to utilize this curriculum to teach the next batch of programmers. I also plan to refine the curriculum as the year progress in hopes that it can be passed on to the next generation of Team 624 programmers.</p>
