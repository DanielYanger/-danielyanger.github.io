<p>This is the code for my robotics team’s 2019 robot, Impulse. Impulse is once again coded in LabVIEW. This was my second year on the programming subteam and took on more responsiblities. I was in charge of the development of autonmous routines for our robot.</p>

<p>I continued to improve upon my LabVIEW skills this year, learning a lot more about the FRC framework. I also learned how to use Isotope, our team’s custom autonomous routine writer.</p>

<p>The repository for the project is not currently public but if the code is released, I will post an update.</p>

<p>This is the end of this project as the 2019 FRC season comes to a close. Next year will be my junior year and I will be taking on even more responsiblities in regards to programming. The current lead programmer is graduating so I will be stepping up in the amount I am programming. Can’t wait for next year!</p>
