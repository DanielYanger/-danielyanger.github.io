<p>Now that I have learned the basics for Python, I decided to start looking into creating a Discord bot for my robotics team’s Discord server.</p>

<p>This project taught me a bit about the Discord API and OAuth. Furthermore, it helped me to continue working on my Python ability.</p>

<p>The project can be found <a href="https://github.com/DanielYanger/DiscordBot">here</a>.</p>

<p>We currently already have a bot on the server that handles just about everything we need it to so there isn’t much use for creating one from scratch. I probably won’t do too much more with this but it was a fun side project.</p>
