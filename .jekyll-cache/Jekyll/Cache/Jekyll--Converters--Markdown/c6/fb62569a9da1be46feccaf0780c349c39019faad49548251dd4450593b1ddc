<p>After putting my blog on a Weebly site for a while, Iâ€™ve decided to start transitioning over to a GitHub Pages and try and get everything onto GitHub. Over the next few months, Iâ€™ll be adding in posts to try and make sure everything was covered.</p>

<h1 id="skills">Skills</h1>

<p>By switching over to a GitHub Pages, Iâ€™ve learned a lot about Ruby, Jekyll, and Git. I hadnâ€™t used much Git prior to this and definitely need work on it but this is a good place to start.</p>

<h1 id="git-project">Git Project</h1>

<p>The Git Project can be found <a href="https://github.com/DanielYanger/danielyanger.github.io">here</a>.</p>

<p>I hope to continue to improve the website by adding in previous blog posts as well as updating it with new posts. Iâ€™ll continue development on it for at least the forseeable future.</p>
