<p>Now that I have become a full-stack developer, I decided to take a crack at fixing up our teamâ€™s blog site. The framework and design of the website was already in place but there were many bugs that needed to be fixed.</p>

<p>Even though the site was built back in 2014 and did not use any of the fancy front-end or back-end langauges that are common-place today, my knowledge as a full-stack developer were very useful. The site uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and PHP+SQL for the backend. I had dabbled with many of these as I learned coding and revisiting them with fresh eyes was very benefical. Additionally, the things I learned about website structure, specifically how to communicate between the front-end and back-end, was extremely useful as it allowed me to navigate the file directory and trace bugs with ease.</p>

<p>Undertaking this was pretty daunting at first. Even though I had used Apache before, it took me a bit of time to get everything configured properly. There were some connection issues to the SQL database that hampered my ability to reload the site quickly. Additionally, since I was not involved in the initial development of the site, I had to navigate through the code to find everything.</p>
