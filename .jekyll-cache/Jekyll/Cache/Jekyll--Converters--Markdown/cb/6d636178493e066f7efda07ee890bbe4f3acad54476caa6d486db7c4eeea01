<p>This is project was my second major project involving website development, the first being the scouting website. This was our main site that was visible to the public.</p>

<h1 id="skills">Skills</h1>

<p>This was my first website project that involved images and more website CSS elements. I learned about website design as well as fine tuned my skills in HTML and CSS. Furthermore, I was exposed to PHP for the first time as that was the language the website was built upon at the time and how to communicate with the SQL server. I also learned about PuTTY and how to SSH into the website to push changes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the code to our main website is not avalible to the public. However, you can view the work at <a href="https://team624.org">team624.org</a>.</p>

<p>This is the end of this project as the 2018 FRC season comes to a close. However, I have 3 more years of robotics left in high school so there will be 3 more robots left to program. Looking forward to these new challenges!</p>
