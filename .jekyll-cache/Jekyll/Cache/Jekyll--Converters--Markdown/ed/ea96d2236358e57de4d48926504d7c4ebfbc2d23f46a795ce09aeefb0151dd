<p>With summer in full swing and a realitivly light course load for summer school, I took this oppurtunity to start my journey to becoming a full stack developer and specifically the MERN Stack. Since I had already touched on React, I decided to start with NodeJS and Express.</p>

<p>With this project, I learned a great deal about Node JS and Express JS. Furthermore, it was a refresher in JavaScript for me after not using it for a long time.</p>

<p>The project can be found <a href="https://github.com/DanielYanger/Learning-Node">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now that I have learned Node, I plan to learn about MongoDB and take the next step to becoming a full stack developer!</p>
