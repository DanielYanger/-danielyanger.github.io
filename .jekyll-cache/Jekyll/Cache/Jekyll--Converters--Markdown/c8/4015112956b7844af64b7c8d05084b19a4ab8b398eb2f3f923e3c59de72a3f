<p>Now that I know MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS, I am officially a full stack developer. I still have a ways to go before I am a competent developer but this is the first step!</p>

<h1 id="skills">Skills</h1>

<p>With this project, I continued working on all of the various skills as part of the MERN Stack.</p>

<h1 id="git-project">Git Project</h1>

<p>I donâ€™t plan on making the project public as it is mostly just code from many different tutorials coupled with my own code. Furthermore, I didnâ€™t hide any sensative information (such as my MongoDB connection password) so I wonâ€™t make them public.</p>

<h1 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h1>

<p>Iâ€™ll be starting a summer camp for computer science and algorithms in the next few days so development will take a backseat. However, I plan to get back to programming and learning new things as soon as possible.</p>
