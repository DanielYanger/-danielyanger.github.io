I"Ö<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>After creating a simple visualization using Python, I decided to try creating a more interative and pretty visualizer. Since I learned React, I decided to use React.</p>

<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

<p>This project allowed me to continue to improve my React skills as well as allowed me to better understand the simple sorting algorithms. Even though I already knew them, to create the animations meant I had to know when the numbers were swapped and how to handle that.</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was adding in a slider to control the size of the array and the speed at which it would be sorted. I could not manage to disable the slider when the sorting started so instead I prevented the state from updating, sovling the issue.</p>

<h2 id="github-repo">Github Repo</h2>

<p>The GitHub repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/DanielYanger/React-Visualizer">here</a>. I managed to publish my project under my githubpages domain, so you can check it out here.</p>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>

<p>This project is quite polished, although I may go back in and add more sorting methods or fix up any bugs.</p>
