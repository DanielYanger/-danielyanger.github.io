I"í<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This is my first project that I am working on with my robotics team, FRC Team 624. We are creating a website to host our scouting system. The purpose of this system is to allow students to quickly and easily input data about the performance of robots during a match. It then stores that data on a SQL server for data analysis to determine which team which should pick.</p>

<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

<p>I learned a lot of useful skills through this project including CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. I worked on mostly the design of certain modules within the site. I used JavaScript to make integer incriminators and zebra striped, sortable tables. This was also my first introduction to Git and version control, something I can definitely improve on as I continue working on the project.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the code to our scouting database is not available to the public. However, I will try and include some images of my work below.</p>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>

<p>I hope to continue to adapt the site as we refine our scouting system. Since I am only a freshman, I have 3 more years on this team and each year requiring an update to this website.</p>
