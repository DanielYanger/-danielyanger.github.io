<p>Over the course of the past few weeks, Iâ€™ve started to learn Python. I completed the Python 3 course on Code Academy as well as a couple of other courses related to Python.</p>

<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

<p>Given that I am already proficient in Java, Python was not difficult to grasp. The syntax took a bit of getting used to and brushing off some of my Java habits took a while.</p>

<p>Now that I know Python, I can start looking into more projects. Even though many of the things I want to do could be done in Java, I want to continue to push myself and improve my Python skills.</p>
