<p>This is my first project that I am working on with my robotics team, FRC Team 624. We are creating a website to host our scouting system. The purpose of this system is to allow students to quickly and easily input data about the performace of robots during a match. It then stores that data on a SQL server for data analysis to determine which team which should pick.</p>

<p>I learned a lot of useful skills through this project including CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I worked on mostly the design of certain modules within the site. I used Javascript to make integer incrementors and zebra striped, sortable tables. This was also my first introduction to Git and version control, something I can defenitly improve on as I continue working on the project.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the code to our scouting database is not avalible to the public. However, I will try and include some images of my work below. <img src="_posts\assets\More-Testing.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>I hope to continue to adapt the site as we refine our scouting system. Since I am only a freshman, I have 3 more years on this team and each year requiring an update to this website.</p>
