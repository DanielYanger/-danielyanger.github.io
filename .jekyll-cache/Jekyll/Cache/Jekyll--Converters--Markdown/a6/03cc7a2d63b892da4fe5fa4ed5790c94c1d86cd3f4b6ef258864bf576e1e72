<p>With more time on my hands due to the COVID-19 outbreak, I took the oppurtunity to learn more about programming. One of the first things I learned about was React. I followed a simple YouTube tutorial that guided me through setting up and using React.</p>

<p>This was my first project that used React and I learned a lot about how it works. Making the simple counters using React was very different compared to JavaScript, which I have done in the past. While it was definitely more complicated to due this simple task, the applications for it are numerous.</p>

<p>The repository for the project is located <a href="https://github.com/DanielYanger/Intro-to-React">here</a>. I didnâ€™t create it as a repository and uploaded it afterwards so there isnâ€™t a history to the project.</p>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>

<p>This is the end of this project as I donâ€™t plan to do too much else with it. It was a fun first delve into React and a refresher about HTML, CSS, and web design. While I may not be using React for a while, it was definetly a great experience.</p>
