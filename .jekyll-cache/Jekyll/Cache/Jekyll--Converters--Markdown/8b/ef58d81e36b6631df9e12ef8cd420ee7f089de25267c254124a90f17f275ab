I"¦<p>My name is Daniel Yang. I am currently a rising senior at Cinco Ranch High School. I have a passion for programming of all kinds, from data analysis to app development. I am currently on my schoolâ€™s robotics team, FRC Team 624. On the team, I am the director of the website subteam and the assistant director of the programming subteam.</p>

<p>In my free time, I love to learn more about programming. This was my first year participating in USACO and achieved Silver after only 1 competition with little formal training. I also like to tinker with small projects to learn more about programming.</p>

<p>In addition to these, I also participate in countless other extra curricular activites. I am an honors member of my schoolâ€™s Academic Decatholon team as well as an Eagle Scout. I have marched 3 years with my high schoolâ€™s marching band and am the Vice President of Tutoring for my schoolâ€™s Mu Alpha Theta program.</p>
