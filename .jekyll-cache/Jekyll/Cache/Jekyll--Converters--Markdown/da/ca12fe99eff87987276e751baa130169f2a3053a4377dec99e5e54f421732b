<p>This summer I participated in the Program in Algorithmic and Combinatorial Thinking with Professor Rajiv Gandhi. I met a bunch of new friends, learned a great deal about theortical computer science, and had a blast.</p>

<p>PACT is a camp that focuses on learning about the math behind computer science, laying the foundation for theortical computer science. I learned about various proof methods, such as induction and contradiction, counting techniques, probablility, and graph theory.</p>

<p>I loved my time at PACT and will be continuing to study under Professor Gandhi through the year round program, where we will be focusing on algorithmic design.</p>
