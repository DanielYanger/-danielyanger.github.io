title: "Learning Python"

## Introduction

Over the course of the past few weeks, I've started to learn Python. I completed the Python 3 course on Code Academy as well as a couple of other courses related to Python.

## Skills

Given that I am already proficient in Java, Python was not difficult to grasp. The syntax took a bit of getting used to and brushing off some of my Java habits took a while.

## Moving Forward

Now that I know Python, I can start looking into more projects. Even though many of the things I want to do could be done in Java, I want to continue to push myself and improve my Python skills.
