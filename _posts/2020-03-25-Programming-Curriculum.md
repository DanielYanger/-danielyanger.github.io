## Introduction

Following the cancellation of the 2020 FRC Season and the subsequent postponement of school, I decided to take this opportunity to revamp our team's programming curriculum. I created 9 different levels split into 3 categories: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each level is designed to teach incoming programmers about LabVIEW and coding.

## Skills

Through the development of this curriculum, I learned a lot about preparing teaching materials and lessons. Each level started with a lesson plan that had objectives, resources, and homework. Some of the lessons then required a presentation to be created while others did not.

## Moving Forward

Since next year will be my senior year, I plan to utilize this curriculum to teach the next batch of programmers. I also plan to refine the curriculum as the year progress in hopes that it can be passed on to the next generation of Team 624 programmers.
