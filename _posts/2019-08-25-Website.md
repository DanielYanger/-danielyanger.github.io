## Introduction

After putting my blog on a Weebly site for a while, I've decided to start transitioning over to a GitHub Pages and try and get everything onto GitHub. Over the next few months, I'll be adding in posts to try and make sure everything was covered.

## Skills

By switching over to a GitHub Pages, I've learned a lot about Ruby, Jekyll, and Git. I hadn't used much Git prior to this and definitely need work on it but this is a good place to start.

## Git Project

The Git Project can be found [here][gh-repo].

## Moving Forward

I hope to continue to improve the website by adding in previous blog posts as well as updating it with new posts. I'll continue development on it for at least the foreseeable future.
