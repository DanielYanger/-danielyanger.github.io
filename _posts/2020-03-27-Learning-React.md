title: "Learning React"

# Introduction

With more time on my hands due to the COVID-19 outbreak, I took the oppurtunity to learn more about programming. One of the first things I learned about was React. I followed a simple YouTube tutorial that guided me through setting up and using React.

# Skills

This was my first project that used React and I learned a lot about how it works. Making the simple counters using React was very different compared to JavaScript, which I have done in the past. While it was definitely more complicated to due this simple task, the applications for it are numerous.

# Git Project

The repository for the project is located [here][gh-repo]. I didn't create it as a repository and uploaded it afterwards so there isn't a history to the project.

# Moving Forward

This is the end of this project as I don't plan to do too much else with it. It was a fun first delve into React and a refresher about HTML, CSS, and web design. While I may not be using React for a while, it was definetly a great experience.
