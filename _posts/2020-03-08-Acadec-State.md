## State

Update time! This past weekend I competed in San Antonio with my Academic Decathlon team. At state, I once again placed in both math and speech. This time however, I score a perfect 1000 on math and was 2nd in speech, both improvements to my regional results. Additionally, we placed 6th overall in Super Quiz and were ranked 7th in the state for large schools. I'm really proud of both my team's results and my own and can't wait to see our improvements next year.
