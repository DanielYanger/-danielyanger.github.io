title: "2018 FRC Power Up Robot Code"
---

# Introduction

This is the code for my robotics team's 2018 robot, PaCRat. PaCRat is coded in LabVIEW. This was my first year on the programming subteam and my first exposure to LabVIEW. As a graphical language, it was very different from other text based languages that I had been learning about such as HTML or Java.

# Skills

This was my first project that used LabVIEW. Additiionally, I learned a lot about hardware integration while programming the robot, such as using encoders, motor controllers, and various sensors.

# Git Project

The repository for the project is located [here][gh-repo]. As a freshman and noivce programmer, I did most of my testing on seperate branches that were later merged onto the master branch by senior programmers.

# Moving Forward

This is the end of this project as the 2018 FRC season comes to a close. However, I have 3 more years of robotics left in high school so there will be 3 more robots left to program. Looking forward to these new challenges!
