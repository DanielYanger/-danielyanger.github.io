# Introduction

After a bit of testing, I have finally implemented the Hyde theme for my personal blog.

# Skills

Through this adventure of figuring out the theme issues, I was able to learn more about many different things, including Git and Jekyll.

# Git Project

The project can be found [here][gh-repo].

# Moving Forward

I like this theme so I'll probably stick with it for a while. I might add a page where all of my posts are visible since I did like that from my previous theme.
