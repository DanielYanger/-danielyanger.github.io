# Introduction

Following the switch to the Hyde theme for my blog, I decided that I wanted to have a page where all my blog posts were visible. So I coded it in as a seperate page.

# Skills

Through this adventure of figuring out how to program this, I learned more about Liquid and HTML to code this in.

# Git Project

The project can be found [here][gh-repo].

# Moving Forward

With AP exams right around the corner, I won't be doing much more development on the site. I really like how it is set up right now and will probably leave it be for a while.
