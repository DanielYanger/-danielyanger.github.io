title: "Pong"

# Introduction

Now that I know the basics of Python, I decided to apply some of what I learned and create a quick game of Pong. This Pong game gradually speeds up as the game progresses, making it more and more challenging the longer the rally is.

# Skills

In addition to improving my basic Python knowledge, I learned about the Python library Turtles and random. Both of these were useful in creating the project.

# Git Project

The project can be found [here][gh-pong].

# Moving Forward

I plan to continue to create small Python projects to improve my python knowledge but with AP exams coming up, I may not have much time.
