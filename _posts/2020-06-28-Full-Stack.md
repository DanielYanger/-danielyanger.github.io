title: "Full Stack Developer"
---

# Introduction

Now that I know MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS, I am officially a full stack developer. I still have a ways to go before I am a competent developer but this is the first step!

# Skills

With this project, I continued working on all of the various skills as part of the MERN Stack. This was especially a refresher on React and learned a lot about how Routers, Components, and Redux works. I defintely still have a long ways to go before becoming as comfortable as I would like to be but this has been a great start.

# Git Project

I don't plan on making the project public as it is mostly just code from many different tutorials coupled with my own code. Furthermore, I didn't hide any sensative information (such as my MongoDB connection password) so I won't make them public.

# Moving Forward

I'll be starting a summer camp for computer science and algorithms in the next few days so development will take a backseat. However, I plan to get back to programming and learning new things as soon as possible.
