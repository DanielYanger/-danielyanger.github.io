title: "Migrating Team Website"

## Introduction

Our team website, an outdated PHP-based website, was in dire need of an update. We decided to transition over to a Wordpress site hosted on Google Cloud in order to provide accessibilty to update the site in the future.

## Skills

Even though the site was based on Wordpress, I learned a great deal about Google Cloud, CSS, and UX. Working with nonprogrammers allowed me to better understand how people would interact with the site, allowing them to maintain and update the site without any programming knowledge.

## Challenges

One challenge I faced was finding enough time to put everything together. With school, robotics, and acadec, there wasn't too much time to put together the website. Without the help of some fellow robotics students, I would not have finished this quickly.

## Moving Forward

With the website up and running, I plan to pass off the reigns to an underclassman to give them experience maintaining and updating the site. You can visit the website [here][team-site].
