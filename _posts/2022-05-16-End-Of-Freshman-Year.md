## Recap

This past year at UT has been an amazing one. I've met some new amazing friends, made countless new memories, tried out new sports, and learned a great deal about computer science. I've take Data Structures, Discrete Math, Computer Architecture, and computational biology classes as well as other math classes. I look forward to my internship at Bloomberg and next year!
