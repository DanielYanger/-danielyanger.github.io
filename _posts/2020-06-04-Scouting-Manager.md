# Introduction

As part of my overhaul of my team's scouting system, I have made a Windows Form that will link the different apps and merge the files.

# Skills

Through this project, I dipped my toes into C# and made a Windows Form in Visual Studio. Additionally, I learned how to make API calls in python and how to properly parse through a JSON file in python.

# Git Project

The project can be found [here][gh-repo].

# Moving Forward

I plan to continue to work on the project and finish debugging it in preparation for next season.

# Update

I finished debugging the form and added a couple of new features! With that, I am just waiting on getting the team tablets to finalize testing.
