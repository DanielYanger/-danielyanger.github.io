# Introduction

While this is not completely programming related, this was my first ever white paper. Our team has long relies on using either paper and pencil scouting or using personal devices to scout. However, with this white paper I was able to convince the board to invest \$2000 into new equipment to help our team scout.

# Skills

Through writing and editing this white paper, I improved my persuasive writing techniques. It also allowed me to better understand project constraints as I had to envision and work within a defined budget to achieve our goals.

# White Paper

The white paper can be found [here][google-doc]. This was the same version that was submitted to the board and approved.

# Moving Forward

With the approval of my proposal, we are moving forward with the current deployment of our new equipment. We have been developing an app that will be optimized for the tablets and allow us to utilize our new resources.
