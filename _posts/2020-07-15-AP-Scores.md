## AP

This year, even with the strange testing conditions due to COVID-19, I still managed to complete my AP exams without any issues. I scored a 5 on AP Calculus BC, AP Physics 1, and AP Chemistry. I'm happy with my scores as I worked extremely hard preparing for the exams and I'm glad my hard work paid off.
