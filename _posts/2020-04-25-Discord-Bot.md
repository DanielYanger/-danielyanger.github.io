title: "Messing around with a Discord Bot"
---

# Introduction

Now that I have learned the basics for Python, I decided to start looking into creating a Discord bot for my robotics team's Discord server.

# Skills

This project taught me a bit about the Discord API and OAuth. Furthermore, it helped me to continue working on my Python ability.

# Git Project

The project can be found [here][gh-repo].

# Moving Forward

We currently already have a bot on the server that handles just about everything we need it to so there isn't much use for creating one from scratch. I probably won't do too much more with this but it was a fun side project.
