# Introduction

I got a bit bored after getting 2/3 of the way through my AP exams, so I decided to just look into some SQL stuff. I created this simple form that handles inputs for my shirt trading addicti, I mean hobby. It's really basic right now and since it's hosted on GitHub Pages doesn't work, but I thought I should show it off anyways.

# Skills

I learned a lot more about SQL, databases, and php, while brushing up on some basic HTML. I created my first personal SQL server (it's on a sketchy site, I know but none of this is important or sensetive) and got it working locally.

# Repository

The repository can be found [here][gh-repo], while the live site (that doesn't work) can be found [here][gh-page].

# Moving Forward

This was a quick project that looks pretty bad. I plan to freshen it up a bit with CSS and add more features to make it more of a website. I plan to add a page where you can view my inventory (need to figure a way to do that on GitHub Pages or move to another free platform) and submit a trade request. Since it's AP week, I don't know when I'll get back to it but we will see.
