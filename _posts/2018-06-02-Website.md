# Introduction

This is project was my second major project involving website development, the first being the scouting website. This was our main site that was visible to the public.

# Skills

This was my first website project that involved images and more website CSS elements. I learned about website design as well as fine tuned my skills in HTML and CSS. Furthermore, I was exposed to PHP for the first time as that was the language the website was built upon at the time and how to communicate with the SQL server. I also learned about PuTTY and how to SSH into the website to push changes.

# Git Project

Unfortunately, the code to our main website is not avalible to the public. However, you can view the work at [team624.org][site-link].

# Moving Forward

This is just the start to my work on the site. Over the next 3 years, I will continue to maintain the site and update it as need be.

# Update September 2019

After much deliberation, the team has elected to move our website to Wordpress. [Team624.org][site-link] will no longer be maintained. The new site can be found at [frc624.org][site-new].
