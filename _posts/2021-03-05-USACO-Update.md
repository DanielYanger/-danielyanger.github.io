## Silver

Today was my last attempt to earn a promotion to gold and unfortunately I fell just short. I scored 733/1000, just under the 800 needed to earn a promotion.

## Moving Forward

This was my last USACO competition so it is a bit disappointing that I didn't get to gold but I am proud of the progress I have made.
