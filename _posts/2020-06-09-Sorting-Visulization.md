# Introduction

Taking a quick break from my development for robotics, I decided to do something I had been meaning to for a while: create a visuzlization for sorting. This had always fasciated me so I decided to finally give it a go using Python.

# Skills

This project introduced me to the Tkinter library as well as more features of the Matplotlib. Furthermore, I learned a great deal about the various sorting methods I implemented, including ones I just learned such as gnome, even-odd, and cocktail shaker.

# Git Project

The project can be found [here][gh-repo].

# Moving Forward

Even though I had some trouble getting started because I named a couple of files things I shouldn't have, I really had a fun time making this. I definetly want to explore similar projects later this summer, including creating a visulization in React and potentially delve into pathfinding.
