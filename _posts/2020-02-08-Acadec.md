## Regionals

This event was very exciting for me as it was my first official competition with my school's Academic Decathlon team. Our team performed very well, placing second in Super Quiz and 3rd overall. Individually, I also placed 2nd overall in math and 3rd overall in speech. Furthermore, I was my team's highest individual score with a 8,524.1 out of 10,000. We have also qualified for state with is a couple of weeks.
