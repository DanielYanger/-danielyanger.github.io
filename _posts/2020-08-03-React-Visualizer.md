title: "React Visualizer"

## Introduction

After creating a simple visualization using Python, I decided to try creating a more interative and pretty visualizer. Since I learned React, I decided to use React.

## Skills

This project allowed me to continue to improve my React skills as well as allowed me to better understand the simple sorting algorithms. Even though I already knew them, to create the animations meant I had to know when the numbers were swapped and how to handle that.

## Challenges

One of the biggest challenges I faced was adding in a slider to control the size of the array and the speed at which it would be sorted. I could not manage to disable the slider when the sorting started so instead I prevented the state from updating, sovling the issue.

## Github Repo

The GitHub repository can be found [here][gh-repo]. I managed to publish my project under my githubpages domain, so you can check it out [here][project].

## Moving Forward

This project is quite polished, although I may go back in and add more sorting methods or fix up any bugs.
