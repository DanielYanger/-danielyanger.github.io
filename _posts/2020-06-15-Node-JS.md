# Introduction

With summer in full swing and a realitivly light course load for summer school, I took this oppurtunity to start my journey to becoming a full stack developer and specifically the MERN Stack. Since I had already touched on React, I decided to start with NodeJS and Express.

# Skills

With this project, I learned a great deal about Node JS and Express JS. Furthermore, it was a refresher in JavaScript for me after not using it for a long time.

# Git Project

The project can be found [here][gh-repo].

# Moving Forward

Now that I have learned Node, I plan to learn about MongoDB and take the next step to becoming a full stack developer!
