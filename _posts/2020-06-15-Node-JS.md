title: "Learning Node"

# Introduction

With summer in full swing and a realitivly light course load for summer school, I took this oppurtunity to start learning Node.

# Skills

With this project, I learned a great deal about Node JS, APIs, and Express JS. Furthermore, it was a refresher in JavaScript for me after not using it for a long time.

# Git Project

The project can be found [here][gh-repo].

# Moving Forward

Now that I have learned Node, I plan to freshen up a bit on React and then become a full stack developer! Stay tuned for that.
