title: About Me
---

My name is Daniel Yang. I am currently Turing Scholar at the University of Texas Austin. I have a passion for programming of all kinds, from data analysis to app development.

I am a graduate of Cinco Ranch High School, where I was on my school’s robotics team, FRC Team 624. On the team, I was the director of the website, programming, and scouting subteams. I was also the VP of Sponsor Relations and Drive Coach. In addition, I also participate in countless other extra curricular activites. I am an honors member of my school’s Academic Decathelon team, earning multiple medals at state, as well as an Eagle Scout. I have marched 3 years with my high school’s marching band and am the President of my school’s Mu Alpha Theta chapter.

In my free time, I love to learn more about programming and tinker with small projects to learn more. I've interned at NASA Johnson Space Center in the robotics department and look forward to all my future experiences!
