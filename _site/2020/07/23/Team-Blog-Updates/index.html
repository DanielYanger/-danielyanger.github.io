  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Now that I have become a full-stack developer, I decided to take a crack at fixing up our teamâ€™s blog site. The framework and design of the website was already in place but there were many bugs that needed to be fixed.</p>

<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

<p>Even though the site was built back in 2014 and did not use any of the fancy front-end or back-end langauges that are common-place today, my knowledge as a full-stack developer were very useful. The site uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and PHP+SQL for the backend. I also got a lot more experience with SSH and how to navigate through the file system on the server. I had dabbled with many of these as I learned coding and revisiting them with fresh eyes was very benefical. Additionally, the things I learned about website structure, specifically how to communicate between the front-end and back-end, was extremely useful as it allowed me to navigate the file directory and trace bugs with ease.</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>Undertaking this was pretty daunting at first. Even though I had used Apache before, it took me a bit of time to get everything configured properly. There were some connection issues to the SQL database that hampered my ability to reload the site quickly. Additionally, since I was not involved in the initial development of the site, I had to navigate through the code to find everything. The biggest challenge, however, was my attempt to implement a file upload system. This had been attempted in the past but had never succeeded. It took me a while but eventually I managed to figure out the issue and had to SSH into the site to change some settings.</p>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>

<p>With all of the changes I have made, the site is completely functional between year to year without the need for any programmers. This was my goal when starting up the development and in that aspect I am complete. However, I may try to add a couple more features or change some CSS to improve the look of the site. Lastly, I also plan to create a curriculum around the site so future developers can improve on it.</p>
