    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>This is project was my second major project involving website development, the first being the scouting website. This was our main site that was visible to the public.</p>

<h1 id="skills">Skills</h1>

<p>This was my first website project that involved images and more website CSS elements. I learned about website design as well as fine tuned my skills in HTML and CSS. Furthermore, I was exposed to PHP for the first time as that was the language the website was built upon at the time and how to communicate with the SQL server. I also learned about PuTTY and how to SSH into the website to push changes.</p>

<h1 id="git-project">Git Project</h1>

<p>Unfortunately, the code to our main website is not avalible to the public. However, you can view the work at <a href="http://team624.org/">team624.org</a>.</p>

<h1 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h1>

<p>This is just the start to my work on the site. Over the next 3 years, I will continue to maintain the site and update it as need be.</p>

<h1 id="update-september-2019">Update September 2019</h1>

<p>After much deliberation, the team has elected to move our website to Wordpress. <a href="http://team624.org/">Team624.org</a> will no longer be maintained. The new site can be found at <a href="http://frc624.org/">frc624.org</a>.</p>
