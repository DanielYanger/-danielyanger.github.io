&lt;p&gt;Now that I know MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS, I am officially a full stack developer. I still have a ways to go before I am a competent developer but this is the first step!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this project, I continued working on all of the various skills as part of the MERN Stack. This was especially a refresher on React and learned a lot about how Routers, Components, and Redux works. I defintely still have a long ways to go before becoming as comfortable as I would like to be but this has been a great start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t plan on making the project public as it is mostly just code from many different tutorials coupled with my own code. Furthermore, I didn’t hide any sensative information (such as my MongoDB connection password) so I won’t make them public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be starting a summer camp for computer science and algorithms in the next few days so development will take a backseat. However, I plan to get back to programming and learning new things as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">MongoDB</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/06/20/Mongo/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="MongoDB" /><published>2020-06-20T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-06-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/06/20/Mongo</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/06/20/Mongo/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After learning Node and Express, I wanted to continue my journey to becoming a full stack developer. With that, I decided to learn about implementing MongoDB into my Express apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this project, I learned a great deal about NoSQL and how MongoDB stores data. Furthermore, I learned how to make API calls and process the data using mongoose and Express.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of sensitive information on the Git project that I forgot to hide before pushing so I will not be sharing the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have learned how to use MongoDB, I plan to freshen up a bit on React and then become a full stack developer! Stay tuned for that. I also plan to explore other NoSQL options such as Firebase just to expand on my knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Learning Node</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/06/15/Node-JS/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Learning Node" /><published>2020-06-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-06-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/06/15/Node-JS</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/06/15/Node-JS/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With summer in full swing and a realitivly light course load for summer school, I took this oppurtunity to start my journey to becoming a full stack developer and specifically the MERN Stack. Since I had already touched on React, I decided to start with NodeJS and Express.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this project, I learned a great deal about Node JS and Express JS. Furthermore, it was a refresher in JavaScript for me after not using it for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DanielYanger/Learning-Node&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have learned Node, I plan to learn about MongoDB and take the next step to becoming a full stack developer!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Python Data Visualization</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/06/09/Sorting-Visulization/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Python Data Visualization" /><published>2020-06-09T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-06-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/06/09/Sorting-Visulization</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/06/09/Sorting-Visulization/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a quick break from my development for robotics, I decided to do something I had been meaning to for a while: create a visuzlization for sorting. This had always fasciated me so I decided to finally give it a go using Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project introduced me to the Tkinter library as well as more features of the Matplotlib. Furthermore, I learned a great deal about the various sorting methods I implemented, including ones I just learned such as gnome, even-odd, and cocktail shaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DanielYanger/Python-Projects/blob/master/visualiztionSorter.py&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I had some trouble getting started because I named a couple of files things I shouldn’t have, I really had a fun time making this. I definetly want to explore similar projects later this summer, including creating a visulization in React and potentially delve into pathfinding.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">624 Scouting Manager</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/06/04/Scouting-Manager/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="624 Scouting Manager" /><published>2020-06-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-06-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/06/04/Scouting-Manager</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/06/04/Scouting-Manager/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of my overhaul of my team’s scouting system, I have made a Windows Form that will link the different apps and merge the files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this project, I dipped my toes into C# and made a Windows Form in Visual Studio. Additionally, I learned how to make API calls in python and how to properly parse through a JSON file in python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DanielYanger/624-Scouting-Manager&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to continue to work on the project and finish debugging it in preparation for next season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished debugging the form and added a couple of new features! With that, I am just waiting on getting the team tablets to finalize testing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New 624 Scouting App</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/31/Scouting-App/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New 624 Scouting App" /><published>2020-05-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-05-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/05/31/Scouting-App</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/31/Scouting-App/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the time between the end of AP exams and the start of summer school, I decided to create a new scouting app for my robotics team. Following the approval of my proposal for new tabelts, our team started using an app called Roblu for scouting. However, I wanted to build a system from the group up tailored for our team. One issue we had while using Roblue was regarding the use of Bluetooth to transmit data. While sometimes it worked, othertimes it would seem to lose data. This is a huge issue so I decided to instead have it export to local files and then use a python script to merge the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first time using Flutter so I learned a lot about both flutter and dart. I picked it up very quickly and in only 2 days, created a system where you can dynamically generate forms using the master app. This allows the system to be used by a head scout even if they have no programming experience. This is crucial to the success of the scouting team. Additionally, I plan to create a couple of python scripts and incorporate them with a C# Windows Form to create an all in one package for the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projects are currently not visible to the public but this status could change in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to continue to refine the app and fix any bugs. Right now I plan to start creating the Python scripts to unite all the aspects of the two apps.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Shirt Trading Database</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/16/Shirt-Trading/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Shirt Trading Database" /><published>2020-05-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-05-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/05/16/Shirt-Trading</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/16/Shirt-Trading/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a bit bored after getting 2/3 of the way through my AP exams, so I decided to just look into some SQL stuff. I created this simple form that handles inputs for my shirt trading addiction, I mean hobby. It’s really basic right now and since it’s hosted on GitHub Pages doesn’t work, but I thought I should show it off anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot more about SQL, databases, and php, while brushing up on some basic HTML. I created my first personal SQL server (it’s on a sketchy site, I know but none of this is important or sensitive) and got it working locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;repository&quot;&gt;Repository&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repository can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DanielYanger/shirtTrading&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, while the live site (that doesn’t work) can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://danielyanger.github.io/shirtTrading/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a quick project that looks pretty bad. I plan to freshen it up a bit with CSS and add more features to make it more of a website. I plan to add a page where you can view my inventory (need to figure a way to do that on GitHub Pages or move to another free platform) and submit a trade request. Since it is AP week, I don’t know when I’ll get back to it but we will see.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Project Page</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/04/Project-Page/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Project Page" /><published>2020-05-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-05-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/05/04/Project-Page</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/04/Project-Page/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the switch to the Hyde theme for my blog, I decided that I wanted to have a page where all my blog posts were visible. So I coded it in as a seperate page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this adventure of figuring out how to program this, I learned more about Liquid and HTML to code this in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DanielYanger/danielyanger.github.io&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With AP exams right around the corner, I won’t be doing much more development on the site. I really like how it is set up right now and will probably leave it be for a while.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New Website Theme</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/04/30/Website-Theme/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New Website Theme" /><published>2020-04-30T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-04-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/04/30/Website-Theme</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/04/30/Website-Theme/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of testing, I have finally implemented the Hyde theme for my personal blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this adventure of figuring out the theme issues, I was able to learn more about many different things, including Git and Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DanielYanger/danielyanger.github.io&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like this theme so I’ll probably stick with it for a while. I might add a page where all of my posts are visible since I did like that from my previous theme.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Messing around with a Discord Bot</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/04/25/Discord-Bot/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Messing around with a Discord Bot" /><published>2020-04-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-04-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/04/25/Discord-Bot</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/04/25/Discord-Bot/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have learned the basics for Python, I decided to start looking into creating a Discord bot for my robotics team’s Discord server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project taught me a bit about the Discord API and OAuth. Furthermore, it helped me to continue working on my Python ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DanielYanger/DiscordBot&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We currently already have a bot on the server that handles just about everything we need it to so there isn’t much use for creating one from scratch. I probably won’t do too much more with this but it was a fun side project.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry></feed>
