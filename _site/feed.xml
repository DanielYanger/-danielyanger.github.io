My name is Daniel Yang and I am a student at Cinco Ranch High School in Katy, Texas. I have a passion for computer science and programming. This is my programming blog where I post about what I am doing in programming. I plan to post whatever projects I have completed and some updates on current projects.</subtitle><entry><title type="html">Learning React</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/27/Learning-React.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Learning React" /><published>2020-03-27T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-03-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/03/27/Learning-React</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/27/Learning-React.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more time on my hands due to the COVID-19 outbreak, I took the oppurtunity to learn more about programming. One of the first things I learned about was React. I followed a simple YouTube tutorial that guided me through setting up and using React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first project that used React and I learned a lot about how it works. Making the simple counters using React was very different compared to JavaScript, which I have done in the past. While it was definitely more complicated to due this simple task, the applications for it are numerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repository for the project is located &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DanielYanger/Intro-to-React&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I didn’t create it as a repository and uploaded it afterwards so there isn’t a history to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the end of this project as I don’t plan to do too much else with it. It was a fun first delve into React and a refresher about HTML, CSS, and web design. While I may not be using React for a while, it was definetly a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Programming Curriculum</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/25/Programming-Curriculum.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Programming Curriculum" /><published>2020-03-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-03-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/03/25/Programming-Curriculum</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/25/Programming-Curriculum.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the cancellation of the 2020 FRC Season and the subsequent postponement of school, I deceided to take this oppurtunity to revamp our team’s programming curriculum. I created 9 different levels split into 3 categories: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each level is designed to teach incoming programers about LabVIEW and coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the development of this curriulum, I learned a lot about preparing teaching materials and lessons. Each level started with a lesson plan that had objectives, resources, and homework. Some of the lessons then required a presentation to be created while others did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;google-drive&quot;&gt;Google Drive&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link to the curriculum can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=12C09_11jrvME_3CtKL9LgwKkSNhXsidO&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since next year will be my senior year, I plan to utilize this curriculum to teach the next batch of programmers. I also plan to refine the curriculum as the year progress in hopes that it can be passed on to the next generation of Team 624 programmers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">USACO December 2019</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/12/14/USACO-Programming.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="USACO December 2019" /><published>2019-12-14T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-12-14T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/12/14/USACO-Programming</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/12/14/USACO-Programming.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;bronze&quot;&gt;Bronze&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was my first attempt at USACO. Prior to this, I had very little exposure to competative programming. I relied mainly on my Java knowledge from AP Computer Science A to get me through. Since it was my first time, I was in the bronze division. I scored a 1000 on my first attempt, giving me a promotion into Silver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to continue to participate in USACO. Due to the robotics season starting up very shortly, I will have little time to practice and prepare for Silver. However, I will try my best throughout all of the competitions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Bronze</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Impulse Robot Code</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/04/25/Impulse-Robot-Code.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Impulse Robot Code" /><published>2019-04-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-04-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/04/25/Impulse-Robot-Code</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/04/25/Impulse-Robot-Code.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the code for my robotics team’s 2019 robot, Impulse. Impulse is once again coded in LabVIEW. This was my second year on the programming subteam and took on more responsiblities. I was in charge of the development of autonmous routines for our robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued to improve upon my LabVIEW skills this year, learning a lot more about the FRC framework. I also learned how to use Isotope, our team’s custom autonomous routine writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repository for the project is not currently public but if the code is released, I will post an update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the end of this project as the 2019 FRC season comes to a close. Next year will be my junior year and I will be taking on even more responsiblities in regards to programming. The current lead programmer is graduating so I will be stepping up in the amount I am programming. Can’t wait for next year!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Eagle Scout Update</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/02/19/Eagle-Scout-Update.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Eagle Scout Update" /><published>2019-02-19T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-02-19T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/02/19/Eagle-Scout-Update</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/02/19/Eagle-Scout-Update.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though this is not related to programming, I thought that it was important nonetheless. Today I completed my Eagle Scout Board of Review and offically became an Eagle Scout. After four and a half years of hard work, dozens of nights spent camping, and countless miles hiked, I have finally reached the top.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Update</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Scouting Whitepaper</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/12/07/Scouting-WP.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Scouting Whitepaper" /><published>2018-12-07T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-12-07T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/12/07/Scouting-WP</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/12/07/Scouting-WP.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is not completely programming related, this was my first ever white paper. Our team has long relies on using either paper and pencil scouting or using personal devices to scout. However, with this white paper I was able to convince the board to invest $2000 into new equipment to help our team scout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through writing and editing this white paper, I improved my persuasive writing techniques. It also allowed me to better understand project constraints as I had to envision and work within a defined budget to achieve our goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;white-paper&quot;&gt;White Paper&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white paper can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q4UFuG-9-dFI42fBowHwvH9mJ2_imZaYjWjXiaBfhoo/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This was the same version that was submitted to the board and approved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the approval of my proposal, we are moving forward with the current deployment of our new equipment. We have been developing an app that will be optimized for the tablets and allow us to utilize our new resources.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Team Blog</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/09/08/Team-Blog.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Team Blog" /><published>2018-09-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-09-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/09/08/Team-Blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/09/08/Team-Blog.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, our team started using a private blog to keep track of the hours our members put into the team. As a sophomore, I was put in charge of maintaining the site and dealing with any issues that students encountered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through my role as the webmaster of the blog, I used a lot of SQL to reference data stored on the team server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, once again, the code to our blog is private and the site is password protected. I will attach some photos of the site below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the team plans to continue using the blog. As the webmaster of the blog, I plan to continue to improve the blog and add features that will aid the team.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Eagle Scout Project</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/07/23/Eagle-Scout-Project.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Eagle Scout Project" /><published>2018-07-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-07-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/07/23/Eagle-Scout-Project</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/07/23/Eagle-Scout-Project.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introducion&quot;&gt;Introducion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I completed my Eagle Scout Project. For my project, I partnered with SEWA International to deliever a STEM and Programming camp to underprivilidged children in the Greater Houston Area. I had many different stations for the children to experience, including making ice cream, bottle rockets, and intro to programming. The kids had a blast and loved the camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;documentation&quot;&gt;Documentation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I have carefully documented everything, I am unable to publish it on the internet. Many of my documents contain personal information that cannot be published. However, if you are interested in it, feel free to send me an email and we can discuss potential ways for you to view them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my project now done, I have almost earned my Eagle Scout rank. Most of the work remaining is paperwork and meetings so I expect to earn it soon. In terms of the camp, I know many other scouts who are interesting in hosting a similar camp so I will be mentoring them and providing guidance to them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Introducion</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Team 624 Main Website</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/06/02/Website.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Team 624 Main Website" /><published>2018-06-02T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-06-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/06/02/Website</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/06/02/Website.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is project was my second major project involving website development, the first being the scouting website. This was our main site that was visible to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first website project that involved images and more website CSS elements. I learned about website design as well as fine tuned my skills in HTML and CSS. Furthermore, I was exposed to PHP for the first time as that was the language the website was built upon at the time and how to communicate with the SQL server. I also learned about PuTTY and how to SSH into the website to push changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the code to our main website is not avalible to the public. However, you can view the work at &lt;a href=&quot;http://team624.org/&quot;&gt;team624.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just the start to my work on the site. Over the next 3 years, I will continue to maintain the site and update it as need be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;update-september-2019&quot;&gt;Update September 2019&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much deliberation, the team has elected to move our website to Wordpress. &lt;a href=&quot;http://team624.org/&quot;&gt;Team624.org&lt;/a&gt; will no longer be maintained. The new site can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://frc624.org/&quot;&gt;frc624.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">2018 FRC Power Up Robot Code</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/04/25/Power-Up-Robot.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2018 FRC Power Up Robot Code" /><published>2018-04-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-04-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/04/25/Power-Up-Robot</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/04/25/Power-Up-Robot.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the code for my robotics team’s 2018 robot, PaCRat. PaCRat is coded in LabVIEW. This was my first year on the programming subteam and my first exposure to LabVIEW. As a graphical language, it was very different from other text based languages that I had been learning about such as HTML or Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first project that used LabVIEW. Additiionally, I learned a lot about hardware integration while programming the robot, such as using encoders, motor controllers, and various sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repository for the project is located &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Team624/2018Robot&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. As a freshman and noivce programmer, I did most of my testing on seperate branches that were later merged onto the master branch by senior programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the end of this project as the 2018 FRC season comes to a close. However, I have 3 more years of robotics left in high school so there will be 3 more robots left to program. Looking forward to these new challenges!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry></feed>
