&lt;p&gt;In the time between the end of AP exams and the start of summer school, I decided to create a new scouting app for my robotics team. Following the approval of my proposal for new tabelts, our team started using an app called Roblu for scouting. However, I wanted to build a system from the group up tailored for our team. One issue we had while using Roblue was regarding the use of Bluetooth to transmit data. While sometimes it worked, othertimes it would seem to lose data. This is a huge issue so I decided to instead have it export to local files and then use a python script to merge the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first time using Flutter so I learned a lot about both flutter and dart. I picked it up very quickly and in only 2 days, created a system where you can dynamically generate forms using the master app. This allows the system to be used by a head scout even if they have no programming experience. This is crucial to the success of the scouting team. Additionally, I plan to create a couple of python scripts and incorporate them with a C# Windows Form to create an all in one package for the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projects are currently not visible to the public but this status could change in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to continue to refine the app and fix any bugs. Right now I plan to start creating the Python scripts to unite all the aspects of the two apps.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Shirt Trading Database</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/16/Shirt-Trading/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Shirt Trading Database" /><published>2020-05-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-05-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/05/16/Shirt-Trading</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/16/Shirt-Trading/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a bit bored after getting 2/3 of the way through my AP exams, so I decided to just look into some SQL stuff. I created this simple form that handles inputs for my shirt trading addiction, I mean hobby. It’s really basic right now and since it’s hosted on GitHub Pages doesn’t work, but I thought I should show it off anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot more about SQL, databases, and php, while brushing up on some basic HTML. I created my first personal SQL server (it’s on a sketchy site, I know but none of this is important or sensitive) and got it working locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;repository&quot;&gt;Repository&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repository can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DanielYanger/shirtTrading&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, while the live site (that doesn’t work) can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://danielyanger.github.io/shirtTrading/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a quick project that looks pretty bad. I plan to freshen it up a bit with CSS and add more features to make it more of a website. I plan to add a page where you can view my inventory (need to figure a way to do that on GitHub Pages or move to another free platform) and submit a trade request. Since it is AP week, I don’t know when I’ll get back to it but we will see.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Pong</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/04/20/Pong/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pong" /><published>2020-04-20T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-04-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/04/20/Pong</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/04/20/Pong/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I know the basics of Python, I decided to apply some of what I learned and create a quick game of Pong. This Pong game gradually speeds up as the game progresses, making it more and more challenging the longer the rally is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to improving my basic Python knowledge, I learned about the Python library Turtles and random. Both of these were useful in creating the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DanielYanger/Python-Projects/blob/master/pong.py&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to continue to create small Python projects to improve my python knowledge but with AP exams coming up, I may not have much time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Learning Python</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/04/15/Python/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Learning Python" /><published>2020-04-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-04-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/04/15/Python</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/04/15/Python/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the past few weeks, I’ve started to learn Python. I completed the Python 3 course on Code Academy as well as a couple of other courses related to Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that I am already proficient in Java, Python was not difficult to grasp. The syntax took a bit of getting used to and brushing off some of my Java habits took a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I know Python, I can start looking into more projects. Even though many of the things I want to do could be done in Java, I want to continue to push myself and improve my Python skills.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Learning React</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/27/Learning-React/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Learning React" /><published>2020-03-27T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-03-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/03/27/Learning-React</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/27/Learning-React/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more time on my hands due to the COVID-19 outbreak, I took the opportunity to learn more about programming. One of the first things I learned about was React. I followed a simple YouTube tutorial that guided me through setting up and using React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first project that used React and I learned a lot about how it works. Making the simple counters using React was very different compared to JavaScript, which I have done in the past. While it was definitely more complicated to due this simple task, the applications for it are numerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repository for the project is located &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DanielYanger/Intro-to-React&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I didn’t create it as a repository and uploaded it afterwards so there isn’t a history to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the end of this project as I don’t plan to do too much else with it. It was a fun first delve into React and a refresher about HTML, CSS, and web design. While I may not be using React for a while, it was definitely a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Programming Curriculum</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/25/Programming-Curriculum/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Programming Curriculum" /><published>2020-03-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-03-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/03/25/Programming-Curriculum</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/25/Programming-Curriculum/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the cancellation of the 2020 FRC Season and the subsequent postponement of school, I decided to take this opportunity to revamp our team’s programming curriculum. I created 9 different levels split into 3 categories: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each level is designed to teach incoming programmers about LabVIEW and coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the development of this curriculum, I learned a lot about preparing teaching materials and lessons. Each level started with a lesson plan that had objectives, resources, and homework. Some of the lessons then required a presentation to be created while others did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;google-drive&quot;&gt;Google Drive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link to the curriculum can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=12C09_11jrvME_3CtKL9LgwKkSNhXsidO&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since next year will be my senior year, I plan to utilize this curriculum to teach the next batch of programmers. I also plan to refine the curriculum as the year progress in hopes that it can be passed on to the next generation of Team 624 programmers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Academic Decathlon State Results</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/08/Acadec-State/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Academic Decathlon State Results" /><published>2020-03-08T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-03-08T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/03/08/Acadec-State</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/08/Acadec-State/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;state&quot;&gt;State&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update time! This past weekend I competed in San Antonio with my Academic Decathlon team. At state, I once again placed in both math and speech. This time however, I score a perfect 1000 on math and was 2nd in speech, both improvements to my regional results. Additionally, we placed 6th overall in Super Quiz and were ranked 7th in the state for large schools. I’m really proud of both my team’s results and my own and can’t wait to see our improvements next year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">State</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Academic Decathlon Regionals Results</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/02/08/Acadec/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Academic Decathlon Regionals Results" /><published>2020-02-08T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-02-08T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/02/08/Acadec</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/02/08/Acadec/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;regionals&quot;&gt;Regionals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event was very exciting for me as it was my first official competition with my school’s Academic Decathlon team. Our team performed very well, placing second in Super Quiz and 3rd overall. Individually, I also placed 2nd overall in math and 3rd overall in speech. Furthermore, I was my team’s highest individual score with a 8,524.1 out of 10,000. We have also qualified for state with is a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Regionals</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">USACO December 2019</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/12/14/USACO-Programming/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="USACO December 2019" /><published>2019-12-14T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-12-14T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/12/14/USACO-Programming</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/12/14/USACO-Programming/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;bronze&quot;&gt;Bronze&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was my first attempt at USACO. Prior to this, I had very little exposure to competitive programming. I relied mainly on my Java knowledge from AP Computer Science A to get me through. Since it was my first time, I was in the bronze division. I scored a 1000 on my first attempt, giving me a promotion into Silver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to continue to participate in USACO. Due to the robotics season starting up very shortly, I will have little time to practice and prepare for Silver. However, I will try my best throughout all of the competitions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Bronze</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New Personal Website</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/08/25/Website/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New Personal Website" /><published>2019-08-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-08-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/08/25/Website</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/08/25/Website/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After putting my blog on a Weebly site for a while, I’ve decided to start transitioning over to a GitHub Pages and try and get everything onto GitHub. Over the next few months, I’ll be adding in posts to try and make sure everything was covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By switching over to a GitHub Pages, I’ve learned a lot about Ruby, Jekyll, and Git. I hadn’t used much Git prior to this and definitely need work on it but this is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;git-project&quot;&gt;Git Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Git Project can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DanielYanger/danielyanger.github.io&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to continue to improve the website by adding in previous blog posts as well as updating it with new posts. I’ll continue development on it for at least the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Yang</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry></feed>
