My name is Daniel Yang. I am currently a rising senior at Cinco Ranch High School. I have a passion for programming of all kinds, from data analysis to app development. I am currently on my schools robotics team, FRC Team 624. On the team, I am the director of the website subteam and the assisstant director of the programming subteam.

In my freetime, I love to learn more about programming. This was my first year participating in USACO and achived Silver after only 1 competition with little formal training. I also like to tinker with small projects to learn more about programming.
